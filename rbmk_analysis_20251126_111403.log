FINAL SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================

HOPF BIFURCATION ANALYSIS RESULTS:

Critical Power: P_Hopf = 579 MW (18.1% nominal)
Below threshold: Limit cycle oscillations (UNSTABLE)
Above threshold: Stable fixed point (STABLE)
Mechanism: Positive void feedback + transport delay

CHERNOBYL MECHANISM (Theory):
  - Reactor operated at 200 MW (in Hopf unstable region)
  - System was oscillating due to void-neutron coupling
  - SCRAM triggered, adding +1β reactivity (graphite tips)
  - Oscillation peak + SCRAM exceeded prompt critical (ρ > β)
  - Result: Exponential power divergence → explosion

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

Why low power is dangerous:
  - Below 579 MW: System oscillates (Hopf instability)
  - Oscillations create periodic void spikes
  - SCRAM during void spike → rho > beta
  - Weak negative feedbacks (low Doppler, low xenon)

Why high power is safer:
  - Above 579 MW: Stable (no oscillations)
  - Strong Doppler feedback
  - Saturated boiling curve (low void sensitivity)
  - Even if rho > beta briefly, feedbacks contain excursion

RBMK Design Flaw:
  - Reactor routinely operated at low power (200 MW)
  - This placed it in the Hopf unstable region
  - Operators unaware that low power meant oscillatory instability

KEY CONCLUSION:
The Hopf bifurcation analysis identifies the critical power threshold
below which the RBMK reactor becomes oscillatory unstable.
This explains why low-power operation (200 MW) was inherently dangerous.
